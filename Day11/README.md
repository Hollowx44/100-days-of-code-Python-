## Overview

### The challenge

- Build a simple text-based Black Jack game. 

## Version

### Version 1.0

- Game has some missing elements.
- The workaround I used to exit the game when the bust or the blackjack condition is met, puts the code in an infinite loop. Which I will fix in the upcoming version.

### Version 1.1

- Fixed the infinte loop workaround.
- Better UI.

### Version 1.2

- Fixed Ace handling logic.
- Fixed initial draw of 21(special condition in Blackjack)

### Built with

- Python

### What I reviewed
- Random Module
- For Loops
- Functions
- Range()
- While Loops
- Recursion
