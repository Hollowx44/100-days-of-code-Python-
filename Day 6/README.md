## Notes

- Notes: This is not the complete solution to the maze problem from the [Reeborgs World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) website as there are certain cases where it results in a infinite loop. In future I'll fix it as my understanding of python gets better.
