### Overview

  - The coffee machine offers three drink choices to the customer: latte, cappuccino, or espresso.
  - After the user chooses preference, the user deposits the amount in coins and change is calculated (if applicable) and displayed to user.
  - User receives drink if money and resources are adequate.
  - If ingredients are not enough or if user did not pay enough, a message is displayed showing the following resource is not enough or money refunded as the payment was not enough respectively.
